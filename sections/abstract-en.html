<h2>Abstract</h2>
  <span>The ontology for Bridge Components (BRCOMP) allows the further classification of Bridge Elements defined in BROT. Furthermore, additional domain-specific data properties can be assigned to the instances of Bridge Element.</span>
  <span>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The namespace for BRCOMP terms is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">https://w3id.org//brcomp#</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    The suggested prefix for the BRCOMP namespace is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">brcomp</span>
  </p>
 <span class="markdown">It is recommended to use BRCOMP in conjunction with BROT for defining a bridge construction and its aggregated components.</span>
