# BRCOMP - Bridge Components
*This repo has been moved from the original wisib server to github*

The ontology for Bridge Components (BRCOMP) allows the further classification of Bridge Elements defined in BROT. Furthermore, additional domain-specific data properties can be assigned to the instances of Bridge Element.

The namespace for BRCOMP terms is `https://w3id.org//brcomp#`

The suggested prefix for the BRCOMP namespace is `brcomp`

It is recommended to use BRCOMP in conjunction with BROT for defining a bridge construction and its aggregated components.
